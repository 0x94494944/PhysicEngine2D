  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a modern, simple, and low-cost efficient 2D physics engine written in C++ using OpenGL, GLFW, and GLEW. </p> 
<p>The engine is currently in developement but is planning to have a 2D objects collision system, velocity, acceleration and gravity.</p>

## Features to add
- [ ] Support for collision detection
- [ ] Support for collision response
- [ ] Simple and intuitive API for creating and managing objects
- [ ] Low-cost efficient design for fast performance
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility with Windows, macOS, and Linux
