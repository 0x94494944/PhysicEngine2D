<p style="font-weight: 700;">32 bits Physic Engine using OpenGL, GLFW, GLEW</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a modern, simple, and low-cost efficient 2D physics engine written in C++ using OpenGL, GLFW, and GLEW. The engine is currently in developement but is planning to have a 2D objects collision system, velocity, acceleration and gravity.</p>

<h2>Future Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Support for collision detection</li>
  <li>Simple and intuitive API for creating and managing objects</li>
  <li>Low-cost efficient design for fast performance</li>
  <li>Cross-platform compatibility with Windows, macOS, and Linux</li>
</ul>
