# PhysicEngine2D
### A 32 bits Physic Engine using OpenGL, GLFW, GLEW

## Introduction
This is a modern, simple, and low-cost efficient 2D physics engine written in C++ using OpenGL, GLFW, and GLEW. The engine is currently in developement but is planning to have a 2D objects collision system, velocity, acceleration and gravity.

## Future Features
Support for collision detection
Simple and intuitive API for creating and managing objects
Low-cost efficient design for fast performance
Cross-platform compatibility with Windows, macOS, and Linux
